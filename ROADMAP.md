## Vision

The vision of Template NN is to provide an intuitive yet flexible framework that accelerates the prototyping of various
neural networks, enabling developers to focus on innovation rather than the intricacies of model implementation.

Template NN was created to address the challenges of quickly iterating on different neural network models without being
hindered by repetitive setup tasks. It now aims to offer the same flexibility and efficiency to the broader machine
learning community.

## Development

This project will use dev builds for iterative development and testing, with formal releases occurring at significant
milestones.

## Milestones

### Model Templates

This milestone focuses on creating a set of flexible and reusable templates for various neural network architectures.
The goal is to make it easy for users to quickly prototype different models without starting from scratch.

**Planned Models**

| Model Name                 | Description                                                            | Status    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Feedforward NN (FNN)**   | A basic fully connected neural network for general purposes.           | Completed |
| **Convolutional NN (CNN)** | A neural network designed for image processing and feature extraction. | Completed |
| **UNet**                   | A U-shaped convolutional network for image segmentation.               | Planned   |
| **GAN**                    | A generative adversarial network for data generation tasks.            | Planned   |
| **Transformer based AutoEncoders** | A model architecture combining Transformers and AutoEncoders.          | Planned   |



### Integration

This milestone will focus on integrating various components and functionalities with the model templates, ensuring smooth
interoperability. The goal is to allow users to seamlessly combine different models and features for
more efficient experimentation.

### Hybridisation

The hybridisation milestone aims to explore and implement hybrid models that combine different types of neural networks
or integrate with other machine learning paradigms. The goal is to enable more advanced use cases by allowing users to easily integrate and experiment with various model
architectures and techniques.
