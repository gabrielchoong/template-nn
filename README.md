# Template NN

Template NN is a lightweight, easy-to-use template designed to serve as a drop-in replacement for PyTorch's core neural network modules, streamlining prototyping and development. It aims to provide a more opinionated and simplified interface while fully leveraging PyTorch's powerful backend.

Huge thanks to the PyTorch team for enabling projects like this.

### Feature Preview

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from template_nn import CNN

# --- Using raw PyTorch (Simple CNN) ---
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(nn.functional.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(nn.functional.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except batch
        x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
